1. Notes that are in key
2. Notes in modes
3. First position triads
4. Intervals (click on note)

# Notes

- Scale is the pattern and labels (A, B, C, etc...) applied to the 12 TET (12 Tonal Equal Temprements)
- Root is note to centre the musical around
- Mode is name given to each bit (degree) of the scale pattern
- Key is the Root and Mode combination
